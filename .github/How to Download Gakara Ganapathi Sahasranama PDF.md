Lord Ganesha is one of the most revered and worshipped deities in Hinduism. He is the son of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, and the brother of Lord Kartikeya. He has an elephant head, a human body, four arms and a pot belly. He rides on a mouse, which symbolizes his control over the ego and the mind. He holds various objects in his hands, such as a modaka (sweet), an axe, a noose and a lotus, which represent his attributes and powers.
 
Lord Ganesha is known by many names and forms, such as Ganapati, Vinayaka, Vighneshwara, Gajanana, Lambodara, Ekadanta and Siddhivinayaka. Each name and form reveals a different aspect of his personality and function. He is the lord of beginnings, success, wisdom, knowledge, arts, sciences, literature and auspiciousness. He is also the remover of obstacles, difficulties and ignorance. He is invoked before starting any new venture or activity, as he grants success and removes hindrances. He is also worshipped as the patron of learning and education.
 
Lord Ganesha is associated with various legends and stories that illustrate his greatness and glory. One of the most famous stories is how he got his elephant head. According to the Puranas, when Lord Shiva was away from home, Goddess Parvati created a boy from the turmeric paste that she used for bathing. She gave him life and asked him to guard the door while she took a bath. When Lord Shiva returned home, he was stopped by the boy who did not recognize him as his father. Lord Shiva got angry and cut off the boy's head with his trident. When Goddess Parvati came out and saw what had happened, she was grief-stricken and furious. She threatened to destroy the whole creation if her son was not brought back to life. Lord Shiva then sent his attendants to find the head of any creature that was facing north. They found an elephant sleeping with its head facing north and brought it to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva then attached the elephant head to the boy's body and revived him. He also declared him as his son and gave him the name Ganesha, meaning the lord of the ganas (Shiva's army).
 
Another famous story is how he became the scribe of the Mahabharata epic. According to the Mahabharata, when Sage Vyasa wanted to compose the epic poem that narrated the history of the Kurukshetra war and the fate of the Kauravas and Pandavas, he needed a scribe who could write down his words without any interruption or error. He prayed to Lord Brahma for help. Lord Brahma suggested that he should ask Lord Ganesha to be his scribe. Sage Vyasa agreed and approached Lord Ganesha with his request. Lord Ganesha agreed on one condition: that Sage Vyasa should recite his verses continuously without any pause or break. Sage Vyasa also imposed a condition: that Lord Ganesha should understand every word before writing it down. Thus began the composition of the Mahabharata epic, which lasted for three years. Lord Ganesha wrote down every word that Sage Vyasa uttered with his broken tusk, which he had used to throw at the moon for mocking his appearance.
 
These are some of the stories that depict the greatness and glory of Lord Ganesha. He is worshipped with love and devotion by millions of people across India and around the world. He is celebrated in various festivals and occasions, such as Ganesh Chaturthi, Sankashti Chaturthi, Vinayaka Chavithi and Ganesh Jayanti. He is also honoured in various temples and shrines dedicated to him.
